Features
X-Wing Algorithm: The solver is powered by the X-Wing algorithm, a sophisticated technique for efficiently solving Sudoku puzzles.

Interactive Interface: A user-friendly web interface built with HTML and CSS allows users to input Sudoku puzzles, initiate the solver, and observe the step-by-step solution.

Solver and Reset Options: The application provides a "Solve" button to initiate the solving process and a "Reset" button to clear the input and start fresh.

Usage
Input Sudoku Puzzle: Enter the initial Sudoku puzzle in the provided input grid.

Solve Puzzle: Click the "Solve" button to activate the X-Wing algorithm and observe the solution unfold.

Reset Puzzle: To start over, click the "Reset" button to clear the input grid.

How it Works
The X-Wing algorithm is a technique used to identify patterns in the puzzle that lead to deductions about the placement of numbers. The solver scans the puzzle, identifies X-Wing patterns, and iteratively applies logic to deduce the correct numbers.
